Problem 177 - First Function ???

Did a dense_rank and a subquery because apparently you can't manipulate the input ???

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      select distinct Salary from (
        select Salary, dense_rank() over(order by Salary desc) r from Employee
      ) as t
      where r = N
  );
END




Problem 1107 

Use MAX/MIN when you want to get the top or lowest value when you group by. I assume order by works after the group by. 

with first_login as #Find first time each person logged in
(select user_id, min(activity_date) activity_date from Traffic
where activity = 'login'
group by user_id)

select activity_date login_date, count(*) user_count
from first_login
group by login_date
having DATEDIFF('2019-06-30',login_date) <= 90;



Problem 1212 - multiple subqueries, get the sum of all of the scores and then inner join at the end.

with host_teams as (
    select team_id, team_name, 
        SUM(CASE WHEN host_goals > guest_goals THEN 3 WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) host_score
    from Teams
    left join Matches
        on Teams.team_id = Matches.host_team
    group by team_name
),
guest_teams as (
    select team_id, team_name, 
        SUM(CASE WHEN guest_goals > host_goals THEN 3 WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) guest_score
    from Teams
    left join Matches
        on Teams.team_id = Matches.guest_team
    group by team_name
)

select guest_teams.team_id, team_name, host_score+guest_score as num_points
from guest_teams
inner join host_teams
using(team_name)
order by num_points desc, team_id asc;
