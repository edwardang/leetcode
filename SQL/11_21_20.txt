Problem 1294 - Using case to aggregate, and then substring to get the november date.

select country_name, (CASE WHEN AVG(weather_state) <= 15 THEN 'Cold'
                          WHEN AVG(weather_state) >= 25 THEN 'Hot'
                          ELSE 'Warm' END) weather_type
from Weather
inner join Countries
using(country_id)
where substring(day,1,7) = '2019-11'
group by country_name;


Problem 620
select id, movie, description, rating from cinema
where id%2=1 and description != 'boring'
order by rating desc;


Problem 1098 - This was a tough one.
Have to use the if statement because you want to account for books in the Books table that are not in orders table,
and they don't have a dispatch date or quantity, so you can't filter off the bat, you have to account for it later on
in the having statement. If you filte rin the where statement, it will take it out first because it is null. 
The if statement comes in clutch in the having statement as well. 

# The tough part is to account for the nulls. 
select book_id, name from books
# left join because we want to get all books.
left join Orders
using(book_id)
where available_from <= '2019-05-23'
group by book_id
having sum(if(dispatch_date>'2018-06-23',quantity,0)) < 10;
