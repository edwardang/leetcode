SQL Practice



Problem 1 - Simple Joining of tables

select FirstName, LastName, City, State from Person
left join Address
    on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;
    

Problem 1322 - using SUM(CASE WHEN ... THEN .. ELSE .. END) to group and count averages.

 select ad_id, 
       IFNULL(
           ROUND(
           SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100/ (SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'Viewed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END))
           ,2) 
       , 0) as ctr 
       from Ads
group by ad_id
order by ctr desc, ad_id asc;

Problem 1322 more efficient - use avg for percentage with 1's and 0's.
Replaced 0 with NULL in the else statement to discount any actions other than clicked and viewed in the avg calculation.

select ad_id, 
       IFNULL(
           ROUND(
           AVG(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1 WHEN action = 'Viewed' THEN 0 ELSE NULL END)*100
           ,2) 
       , 0) as ctr 
       from Ads
group by ad_id
order by ctr desc, ad_id asc;




Problem 1565 - group by month in the date and get count of distinct orders and customers.

select SUBSTRING(order_date,1,7) as month, count(distinct order_id) as order_count, count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count from Orders
where invoice > 20
group by month; 



Problem 574 - get winning candidate by joining the tables.

select Name from Candidate
inner join Vote
    on Candidate.id = Vote.CandidateId
group by CandidateId
order by COUNT(*) desc
limit 1;



Problem 613 - Subtracting values from the same table itself. 

select min(ABS(p1.x - p2.x)) as shortest
from point p1, point p2
where p1.x != p2.x;


Problem 607 - Joining 3 tables and getting the inverse of the names you are searching for.

#Pam also sold to 3, so you need another approach. Find all that sold to 1, and then take whoever is left. There can be duplicate orders. 
#Also you need to find a way to join 3 tables.

select name from salesperson
where name not in (
    select salesperson.name from salesperson
    left join orders
        on salesperson.sales_id = orders.sales_id
    left join company
        on orders.com_id = company.com_id
    where company.name = 'RED'
    );
