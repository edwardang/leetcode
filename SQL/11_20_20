Problem 1113

MY solution

Careful on the number of posts reported. Understand the problem and dataset before you start tackling the problem.
I also think distinct may only work opn one column.

select extra report_reason, count(distinct post_id) report_count from Actions
where action_date = '2019-07-04' and action = 'report'
group by extra
having extra is not null and count(*) > 0;

Other solution from discussions with DATEDIFF

select extra report_reason, count(distinct post_id) report_count
from actions
where DATEDIFF('2019-07-05',action_date)=1
and extra is not null and action = 'report'
group by extra
