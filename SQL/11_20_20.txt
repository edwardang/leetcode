Problem 1113

MY solution

Careful on the number of posts reported. Understand the problem and dataset before you start tackling the problem.
I also think distinct may only work opn one column.

select extra report_reason, count(distinct post_id) report_count from Actions
where action_date = '2019-07-04' and action = 'report'
group by extra
having extra is not null and count(*) > 0;

Other solution from discussions with DATEDIFF

select extra report_reason, count(distinct post_id) report_count
from actions
where DATEDIFF('2019-07-05',action_date)=1
and extra is not null and action = 'report'
group by extra


Problem 1045 - Bought ALL the products from the other table. So you jus tcount up the distinct products in product key and see which customers also have that count. 


Unrelated - any & all in SQL query
select product_key from Product
where product_key < ANY (select product_key from Customer);


My solution 
select customer_id from Customer
group by customer_id
having count(distinct product_key) = (
    select count(distinct product_key) from Product    
);


Other's solution: take sum of distinct key but there are holes in that, as some other numbers could potentially add up to that number.

select customer_id 
from customer
group by customer_id
having sum(distinct product_key)=
(select sum(product_key) from product)


But if the Product table didn't have all the products and only a subset, how would you solve it?
