SQL Practice



Problem 1 - Simple Joining of tables

select FirstName, LastName, City, State from Person
left join Address
    on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;
    

Problem 1322 - using SUM(CASE WHEN ... THEN .. ELSE .. END) to group and count averages.

 select ad_id, 
       IFNULL(
           ROUND(
           SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100/ (SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'Viewed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END))
           ,2) 
       , 0) as ctr 
       from Ads
group by ad_id
order by ctr desc, ad_id asc;

Problem 1322 more efficient - use avg for percentage with 1's and 0's.
Replaced 0 with NULL in the else statement to discount any actions other than clicked and viewed in the avg calculation.

select ad_id, 
       IFNULL(
           ROUND(
           AVG(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1 WHEN action = 'Viewed' THEN 0 ELSE NULL END)*100
           ,2) 
       , 0) as ctr 
       from Ads
group by ad_id
order by ctr desc, ad_id asc;




Problem 1565 - group by month in the date and get count of distinct orders and customers.

select SUBSTRING(order_date,1,7) as month, count(distinct order_id) as order_count, count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count from Orders
where invoice > 20
group by month; 



Problem 574 - get winning candidate by joining the tables.

select Name from Candidate
inner join Vote
    on Candidate.id = Vote.CandidateId
group by CandidateId
order by COUNT(*) desc
limit 1;
